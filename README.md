# Multilingual-Online-Translator

When calling the program from the command line, you enter 3 words: 
- the language from which you want to translate the word
- the language into which you want to translate the word (or all, if you want to translate it into all possible languages) 
- the word you want to translate.
The result is saved in a txt file with a title that is the same as the translated word. And it is printed.
