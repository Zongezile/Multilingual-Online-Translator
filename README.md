# Multilingual-Online-Translator

When calling the program from the command line, you enter 3 words: 
- the language from which you want to translate the word
- the language into which you want to translate the word (or all, if you want to translate it into all possible languages) 
- the word you want to translate.

The result of translations with example sentences (context) is saved in a txt file with a title identical to the translated word and it's printed.
